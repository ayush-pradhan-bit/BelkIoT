## Task Description:
Our first task uses couple of led(s) few resistors of values between 1kohm and 10kohm, few jumpwires and breadboard.
We make a small simulation of how a miniature traffic light works using simple C++ code and arduino IDE.

Moving on to the next task, we have to build a small frequency musical instrument using Piezo buzzer.

Piezo buzzer can be used in various places like 

++ Trigger alarm

++ warning devices

++ clocks

++ vechicle warning devices

Lastly, we make use of the UltraSonic sensor and detect the distance of the objects.

UltraSonic sensor is a useful device and can be used in various aspects like:

++ measuring food / drink level in a container

++ Blind spot detection in cars

++ human detection alert in shops

# LEARNING FROM THE COURSE

I was able to understand and use various IoT devices using Arduino Ide, this helped me to expand my though about small projectsa that can be used in day to day life.
The bootcamp helped me get in touch with various people from IoT Industries and also help me establish a base for the field.
